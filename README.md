# Moonshot üöÄ

This project aims to grab two official NASA .json files containing data about missions and astronauts who participated in said missions, decode them appropiately with Swift's built-in JSONDecoder() and display the data in a somewhat stylish style using a List View.

The projects main goal was to practice and get familiar with a couple of concepts such as:

- As usual, overall Swift / SwiftUI ‚ù§Ô∏è
- [Generics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Generics.html)
- [Extensions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Extensions.html)
- [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) (Being able to decode JSON into your own custom types in such an easy way is....gold).
- [Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html)
- Many more
